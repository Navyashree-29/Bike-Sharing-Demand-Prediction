# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict the demand for bike sharing systems based on historical usage data and various environmental and seasonal factors. The goal was to create a reliable regression model that can estimate the number of bikes required in a given hour, helping bike-sharing services optimize fleet management and improve user satisfaction.
##Project Workflow:

#Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The dataset used for this project includes historical data on bike rentals along with weather conditions, date, and time features. The data was cleaned, missing values were handled, and categorical variables were encoded for machine learning.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

We performed an extensive EDA to uncover patterns in the data. Key trends related to seasonal demand, temperature effects, time of day, and weather conditions were analyzed to gain insights into how these factors influence bike rental activity.

#Feature Engineering:

Additional features such as hour of the day, day of the week, and seasonality were created to improve the predictive power of the model. Correlation analysis helped in selecting the most significant variables to include in the model.

#Model Selection and Training:

Multiple regression models were explored, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The models were trained and tested using cross-validation techniques to ensure accuracy and robustness. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the models.

#Model Evaluation:

The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The best-performing model was selected based on its ability to generalize to unseen data, offering accurate and reliable predictions.

#Results and Conclusion:

The final model provided accurate demand predictions, which can be used by bike-sharing companies to adjust the availability of bikes according to demand, reduce downtime, and ensure better service. This solution can help optimize resource allocation, reduce operational costs, and improve customer experience.
